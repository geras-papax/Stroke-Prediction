# Stroke-Prediction
With the use of several methods we make prediction if a patient will have a stroke. \
We solve the empty values problem with 4 methods:
- Remove columns with empty values
- Replace empty values with mean value of the column
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest-Neighbors \
\
For classification we use:
- Random Forest
